## Welcome to My ePortfolio

Here you will be able to look at some of the projects that I have worked on in the past and added enhancements to them. You will be able to watch my code review and understand the changes I planned to make for this class. Next you will find three artifacts that I performed the enhancement on. Followed up with a self assement on myself througout the Computer Science program here at SNHU.
