## Welcome to My ePortfolio
My time in the program at SNHU I have learned a great deal about myself and what areas I want to focus on more. I learned many different programming languages and different applications for each type of programming language. I found myself wanting to learn more about autonomous vehicles and the programming and software that went along with it. My other favorite was using programming to create and update databases. This will be helpful if I decide not to make a career change. Listed below are some of the projects that I found to be the most interesting to me during the program. I found myself wanting to expand and create new ways to use the final projects that I finished previously for other classes. You will be able to watch my code review and understand the changes I planned to make for this class. Next you will find three artifacts that I performed the enhancement on.

##  Artifact Enhancements

Throughout the Computer Science Program at SNHU, I have worked on many different projects and For my Portfolio I decided to take three artifacts that I have worked on and added some enhancements to these artifacts Here are the Artifacts that I have enhanced:

### Temp and Humidity Sensor

The temperature and humidity sensor are a project I worked on earlier this year for my CS 350 Emerging Systems Architecture and Technology. This project was using the raspberry pi + and grove pi + creating a program to read the temperature and humidity in a space and using LEDs we can trigger certain LEDs based upon the temperature and humidity that was read.  I chose this artifact because I felt this was a program that I could use in real life or I can apply the same logic to create a system that works for home use. The enhancements that were made were to enhance the if statements to create scenarios that would benefit in in a house or at a business. I wanted to enhance the program so that I could create a program that would help in businesses or at home. If humidity regulation was needed, we can apply another device to communicate, and act based on certain criteria. 

### Hash Table

The Hash table was created in June of 2020 and showcased data algorithms and ways to sort through numbers faster than typical the sort method. This project we created the hash method and compared the time comparisons, and we could see how fast we can sort through a series of data. If we are looking for a particular id number out of hundreds of thousand id numbers, it can take many seconds or with the sort method mere seconds. The reason I chose this artifact to showcase is because data algorithms are important when sorting through data, and there are numerous ways to incorporate this into programs and into games. The enhancements that I added just cleaned up some of the case syntax that I created and added a few minimal changes to the program. After completing this project the first time, I had learned more knowledge of programming and decided to add some of that knowledge to the this project since I found this to lack some advanced programming logic.

### SQL Queries
<a href=https://github.com/bemoore711/bemoore711.github.io/tree/main/SQL%20Queries> <img src="https://github.com/bemoore711/bemoore711.github.io/blob/main/MISC/SQL Queries.png" width=200></a>

SQL queries project was completed in August of 2020. This was my first time learning and using Codio to produce SQL to create a database, insert data in the database, and changing information in the database. The Final project consisted of gathering specific information needed to present in a business report based on the data in the database. The reason I wanted to re-work this artifact is that I plan to learn ore about SQL database at my current career. The software that we use does use SQL databases and will help me further my career at my company. For this project I just played around with more queries and pulled more information out of the database that would be beneficial to a business report. Within the artifact you can see where I pull more information and how that will be useful.





##### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bemoore711/bemoore711.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
